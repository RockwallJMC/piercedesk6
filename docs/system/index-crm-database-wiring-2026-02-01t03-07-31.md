# INDEX: CRM Section - Complete Database Wiring

## Feature Overview

Convert the entire CRM section from mock data to live Supabase database integration. The CRM section consists of 5 fully-implemented UI pages (73 CRM components + 17 dashboard components) currently using hardcoded mock data from 4 data files. This project will implement database schema, migrations, RLS policies, API endpoints, SWR data hooks, and complete integration testing while preserving all existing UI/UX.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Supabase schema with 5 tables (companies, contacts, deals, deal_collaborators, activities)
- 20+ API endpoints for CRUD operations
- 8+ SWR data fetching hooks
- Complete test coverage (data, API, UI, E2E layers)
- Remove all 4 mock data files
- Dashboard analytics powered by real aggregations

**Business Value:**
- Real data persistence across sessions
- Multi-user CRM functionality
- Accurate analytics and reporting
- Foundation for advanced CRM features (automations, integrations, AI)

## Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Single Activities Table with JSONB Metadata
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Context**: Activities include multiple types (calls, emails, meetings, notes, tasks) with different attributes
- **Decision**: Use single `activities` table with `metadata` JSONB column for type-specific fields
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, flexibility, and easy cross-type queries outweigh strict typing benefits
- **Impact**: Phases 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 (all activity-related functionality)

### Decision 2: Kanban Stage Updates via PATCH
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Context**: Deals move between Kanban columns via drag-and-drop
- **Decision**: Update `deals.stage` and `deals.stage_order` fields via PATCH endpoint
- **Rationale**: Simple, direct approach sufficient for MVP; can add custom stages table later if needed
- **Impact**: Phase 1.1 (Kanban drag-and-drop persistence)

### Decision 3: User-Scoped RLS Policies
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Context**: Multi-tenant data isolation required
- **Decision**: Implement RLS policies filtering by `auth.uid()` on all tables
- **Rationale**: Security best practice, prevents data leaks even if application logic fails
- **Impact**: All phases (every table has RLS policies)

### Decision 4: Bottom-Up Implementation Order
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Context**: 5 pages with varying dependency complexity
- **Decision**: List → Create → Interaction (simple) → Interaction (complex) → Dashboard
- **Rationale**: Validates core schema first, builds complexity incrementally, dashboard requires all data
- **Impact**: Phase execution order (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Phase | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|------------|-------|
| Drag-and-drop breaks with live data | High | Medium | 1.1 | Extensive Layer 3 testing, preserve @dnd-kit logic | react-mui-frontend-engineer |
| RLS policies too restrictive | Medium | Low | All | Comprehensive Layer 1 tests, seed with multiple users | supabase-database-architect |
| Dashboard queries too slow | Medium | Medium | 1.5 | Add indexes on aggregation fields, consider materialized views | supabase-database-architect |
| Mock data structure mismatch | High | Low | All | Compare mock vs schema carefully, seed data mirrors mocks | supabase-database-architect |
| Activities metadata inconsistency | Low | Medium | 1.3, 1.4 | Document JSONB schema per type, validate in API layer | wiring-agent |
