# INDEX: CRM Desk - MVP Implementation

## Feature Overview

Implement the complete CRM Desk as the MVP for PierceDesk - managing customer relationships from first contact through closed deals. This establishes the foundation for the Digital Thread and demonstrates the Desk-First Architecture.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Complete database schema with multi-tenant RLS
- Lead capture and qualification workflow
- Opportunity pipeline (Kanban board)
- Proposal generation with PDF export
- Account and contact management
- CRM Dashboard with key metrics
- Activity timeline (Digital Thread foundation)
- Comprehensive E2E test coverage

**Business Value:**

- First revenue-generating desk operational
- Demonstrates platform viability
- Foundation for all other desks
- Client digital thread begins here

## Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Defer Drawer Architecture

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Context**: Original vision included contextual drawers
- **Decision**: Build traditional navigation for MVP, add drawers post-MVP
- **Rationale**: Faster time-to-market, validate core desk functionality first
- **Impact**: All phases will use traditional navigation patterns

### Decision 2: Aurora Kanban for Pipeline

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Context**: Need opportunity pipeline visualization
- **Decision**: Use Aurora's existing Kanban app, customize for opportunities
- **Rationale**: Proven component, matches design system, rapid implementation
- **Impact**: Phase 1.5 leverages existing code

### Decision 3: React-PDF for Proposals

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Context**: Need PDF export for proposals
- **Decision**: Use React-PDF library for PDF generation
- **Rationale**: Declarative React syntax, good documentation, active maintenance
- **Impact**: Phase 1.6 adds React-PDF dependency
