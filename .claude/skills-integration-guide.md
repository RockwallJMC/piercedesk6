# Skills Integration Guide

This guide explains how Claude Code skills (`.claude/skills/`) integrate with agents (`.claude/agents/`) and the overall development workflow for PierceDesk.

## CRITICAL: Development Server Constraints

**NEVER run `npm run dev` in the background:**
- If you need to start the dev server, inform the user and let them start it manually
- NEVER use `run_in_background: true` with Bash tool for `npm run dev`
- Dev servers must run in the terminal for proper log visibility and clean restarts
- This is a strict requirement across all agents and workflows

## Overview

**Skills** are reusable, enforced development practices that act as quality gates throughout your workflow. They ensure critical practices like TDD, verification before completion, and architectural standards are followed consistently.

**Agents** are specialized sub-agents that handle specific types of work (frontend, backend, database, testing, documentation). Agents should invoke skills at appropriate checkpoints in their workflows.

## Available Skills

### 1. TDD (Test-Driven Development)
**Location:** `.claude/skills/TDD/SKILL.md`
**Invocation:** `/TDD` or Skill tool with `skill: "TDD"`

**Purpose:** Enforce red-green-refactor cycle for all code implementation

**When to Invoke:**
- BEFORE writing any implementation code
- When fixing bugs (write failing test first)
- When adding new features

**Core Principle:** Write test → Watch it fail → Write minimal code to pass → Refactor

**Key Rules:**
- NO production code without a failing test first
- Code written before test must be deleted
- Watch each test fail before implementing
- Tests written after prove nothing

**See Also:** `.claude/skills/TDD/testing-anti-patterns.md` for common pitfalls

### 2. VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE / using-superpowers
**Location:** `.claude/skills/VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`
**Invocation:** `/verify` or `/using-superpowers` or Skill tool

**Purpose:** Enforce evidence-based completion claims (no assertions without proof)

**When to Invoke:**
- BEFORE claiming work is complete, fixed, or passing
- BEFORE committing code
- BEFORE creating PRs
- BEFORE moving to next task

**Core Principle:** Evidence before assertions, always

**Key Rules:**
- Run verification command in THIS conversation turn
- Show full output (test results, build output, API responses)
- Never use "should", "probably", "seems to"
- No completion claims without fresh evidence

**Verification Evidence Examples:**
- Tests pass → Show test command output with 0 failures
- Build succeeds → Show build command with exit code 0
- API works → Show API response output
- Bug fixed → Show test that catches the bug, then fixed version

### 3. software-architecture
**Location:** `.claude/skills/software-architecture/SKILL.md`
**Invocation:** `/software-architecture` or Skill tool with `skill: "software-architecture"`

**Purpose:** Enforce Clean Architecture and DDD principles

**When to Invoke:**
- When designing code architecture
- When making architectural decisions
- When writing any code (for quality standards)
- During code reviews

**Core Principles:**
- **Library-first approach:** Search npm BEFORE writing custom code
- **Domain-specific naming:** Avoid generic names like `utils`, `helpers`, `common`
- **Separation of concerns:** No business logic in UI, no DB queries in controllers
- **Clean Architecture:** Follow bounded contexts and ubiquitous language
- **Early returns:** Prefer early returns over nested conditions

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Building custom auth instead of using Auth0/Supabase
- Creating `utils.js` with 50 unrelated functions
- Writing custom state management instead of using established libraries
- Mixing business logic with UI components

### 4. file-organizer
**Location:** `.claude/skills/file-organizer/SKILL.md`
**Invocation:** `/file-organizer` or Skill tool with `skill: "file-organizer"`

**Purpose:** Intelligently organize files and folders

**When to Invoke:**
- When organizing files and folders
- When codebase structure needs cleanup
- When finding duplicates or suggesting better structures
- When cognitive load from disorganization is high

### Pattern 2: Backend Integration (wiring-agent)

```
User Request: "Create an API hook to fetch user devices"

Agent Workflow:
1. Analyze requirements (API endpoint, data structure)
2. INVOKE software-architecture skill

### Pattern 4: End-to-End Testing (playwright-tester)

```
User Request: "Write tests for the checkout flow"

Agent Workflow:
1. Discover test structure (Glob/Grep)
2. Plan test scenarios
3. INVOKE TDD skill (Playwright IS TDD)
   → Write test for checkout flow
   → Run test, watch it fail (feature not implemented or broken)

### Pattern 5: Documentation (documentation-expert)

```
User Request: "Document the new authentication API"

Agent Workflow:
1. Read source code thoroughly
2. INVOKE software-architecture skill
   → Understand domain concepts (authentication, authorization)
   → Identify architectural patterns (JWT, RLS, etc.)
   → Note bounded contexts
3. Analyze existing documentation patterns
4. Draft documentation
   → Include accurate code examples
   → Document domain-specific behavior
   → Match project conventions
5. INVOKE VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE skill
   → Run code examples, show they execute without errors
   → Compare documented API signatures with actual code
   → Check all links, show results
   → Test documented config options
6. Claim documentation complete WITH evidence shown
```

---

## How to Invoke Skills

### Method 1: Slash Commands (User or Agent)
```
/TDD
/verify
/using-superpowers
/software-architecture
/file-organizer
```

### Method 2: Skill Tool (Agent)
```
Use Skill tool with:
- skill: "TDD"
- skill: "VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE"
- skill: "using-superpowers"
- skill: "software-architecture"
- skill: "file-organizer"
```

### Method 3: Auto-invocation by Agents
Agents should automatically reference and invoke skills at appropriate workflow points (as documented in their agent files).

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Skipping TDD
**Wrong:**
```
1. Write implementation code
2. Manually test it
3. Write tests after
4. Claim "tests pass"
```

**Why it's wrong:** Tests written after code pass immediately, proving nothing. You never verified the test actually catches bugs.

**Right:**
```
1. INVOKE TDD skill
2. Write test, watch it fail
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Refactor
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Claiming Without Verification
**Wrong:**
```
"The API integration should work now"
"Tests are probably passing"
"Build seems to be successful"
```

**Why it's wrong:** No evidence, just assumptions. Code might be broken.

**Right:**
```
INVOKE VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE skill
Run: npm test
Output: 34/34 tests passed ✓
"All tests pass (verified with npm test, 34/34 passing)"
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Building Custom Utilities
**Wrong:**
```
// Create custom retry logic
function retryWithBackoff(fn, maxRetries) {
  // 50 lines of custom retry code...
}
```

**Why it's wrong:** NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome. Maintenance burden.

**Right:**
```
INVOKE software-architecture skill
→ Search npm for "retry"
→ Find cockatiel library
→ Use existing, tested solution

import { retry } from 'cockatiel';
const result = await retry(execute, { maxAttempts: 3 });
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Generic Naming
**Wrong:**
```
// utils.js
export function formatData(data) { ... }
export function validateInput(input) { ... }
export function processItems(items) { ... }
```

**Why it's wrong:** No domain context, hard to find, dumping ground for unrelated functions.

**Right:**
```
INVOKE software-architecture skill
→ Use domain-specific names

// equipment/EquipmentFormatter.ts
export function formatEquipmentMaintenanceRecord(record) { ... }

// auth/UserInputValidator.ts
export function validateUserRegistrationInput(input) { ... }
```

## Integration with Other Frameworks

Skills work alongside:

### PIERCE-SYS-EXE Orchestration
- PIERCE-SYS-EXE handles feature orchestration (phases, checkpoints, INDEX.md)
- Skills enforce quality practices within each phase
- Example: During implementation phase, invoke TDD and VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE

### AGENTS-MAIN Coding Standards
- AGENTS-MAIN provides domain-specific coding standards
- Skills provide universal quality gates
- Example: UI/UX agent guidelines + TDD skill + software-architecture skill

### Workflow Integration
```
Feature Request
    ↓
PIERCE-SYS-EXE Orchestration (Strategic → Assessment → Planning → Implementation)
    ↓
Agent Selection (react-mui-frontend-engineer, wiring-agent, etc.)
    ↓
Skills Invocation (TDD, VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE, software-architecture)
    ↓
Quality Code Delivered
```

## Quick Reference

### When to Use Which Skill

| Situation | Skill to Invoke |
|-----------|-----------------|
| About to write implementation code | TDD |
| About to claim work complete | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE |
| About to commit/create PR | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE |
| Designing architecture | software-architecture |
| Making code structure decisions | software-architecture |
| Choosing between libraries | software-architecture |
| Organizing files | file-organizer |
| Writing any code | software-architecture (for quality standards) |
| Before "tests pass" claim | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE |
| Before "build succeeds" claim | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE |

---

## Remember

**Skills are NOT optional suggestions** - they are mandatory quality gates that prevent:
- Broken code being committed
- Tests written after implementation (proving nothing)
- Over-engineering and NIH syndrome
- Generic code dumping grounds
- Unverified completion claims

**When in doubt:** Invoke the skill. Better to be thorough than to ship broken code.
