# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**PierceBoard** is a Turborepo monorepo containing the PierceDesk.AI platform - a unified SaaS solution for physical security integration operations. The codebase uses Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, Material-UI 7, and follows an Aurora-first UI development pattern.

## Build & Development Commands

### Monorepo Commands (from root)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start all apps in dev mode (TERMINAL ONLY - NEVER use run_in_background)
npm run dev

# Build all apps and packages
npm run build

# Run linting across all workspaces
npm run lint

# Clean all build artifacts
npm run clean
```

### Pierce Desk App (from apps/pierce-desk)
```bash
# Dev server on port 4000 (TERMINAL ONLY - NEVER use run_in_background)
npm run dev

# Production build with increased memory
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Clean Next.js build
npm run clean
```

**IMPORTANT: Development Server Constraints**
- `npm run dev` must ONLY be run in the terminal directly
- NEVER use `run_in_background: true` parameter with Bash tool for dev servers
- This ensures proper visibility of logs, errors, and the ability to stop/restart cleanly
- If dev server needs to be started, inform the user and let them start it manually

## Monorepo Architecture

### Package Organization

**Apps:**
- `apps/pierce-desk/` - Main Next.js application (runs on port 4000)

**Packages:**
- `packages/aurora/*` - Aurora UI design system (6 packages: ui, theme, hooks, providers, layouts, sections)
- `packages/mantis/*` - Mantis UI alternative design system (6 packages: ui, theme, hooks, providers, layouts, sections)
- `packages/shared/*` - Shared utilities (auth, services, utils, config, data, routes, locales)
- `packages/config/*` - Shared configuration (eslint-config)

**Templates:**
- `templates/aurora-next/` - Source of truth for Aurora UI components and patterns
- `templates/mantis-next/` - Mantis UI template reference

### Package Import Patterns

Packages are referenced using workspace protocol:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@pierce/aurora-ui';
import { useTheme } from '@pierce/aurora-hooks';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@pierce/aurora-providers';
import { DashboardLayout } from '@pierce/aurora-layouts';
import { api } from '@pierce/services';
import { formatDate } from '@pierce/utils';
```

## Critical Development Workflows

### Mandatory Execution Framework (ALWAYS REQUIRED)

**This is the foundation of ALL work in this repository. No exceptions.**

#### 1. Skills Are NOT Optional - They Are MANDATORY

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
**Skills MUST be invoked BEFORE any action, even clarifying questions.**

If there is even a 1% chance a skill applies, you MUST invoke it. This is non-negotiable.
</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**When to invoke skills:**
- Starting ANY conversation → `/using-superpowers` skill
- Before ANY implementation → `/TDD` skill
- Before ANY architectural decision → `/software-architecture` skill
- Before claiming ANYTHING is complete → `/VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE` skill
- Multi-step features → `/writing-plans` skill
- Any bug/failure → `/systematic-debugging` skill
- File organization → `/file-organizer` skill

**Use the Skill tool:**
```javascript
// Example invocations
Skill tool with skill: "using-superpowers"
Skill tool with skill: "TDD"
Skill tool with skill: "VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE"
Skill tool with skill: "software-architecture"
```

**Red flags that mean you're rationalizing (STOP):**
- "This is just a simple task" → Check for skills anyway
- "I need context first" → Skills tell you HOW to gather context
- "Let me explore first" → Skills tell you HOW to explore
- "I remember this skill" → Skills evolve, invoke current version
- "The skill is overkill" → If it exists, use it

#### 2. Sub-Agents Are NOT Optional - They Are MANDATORY

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
**ALWAYS use the Task tool with specialized sub-agents for executing work.**

TodoWrite is for TRACKING tasks, but Task tool is for EXECUTING them.
</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**Use Task tool for ALL:**
- Feature implementation → `react-mui-frontend-engineer`, `wiring-agent`, `supabase-database-architect`
- Test creation → `playwright-tester`
- Code exploration → `Explore` agent (thoroughness: quick/medium/very thorough)
- Documentation → `documentation-expert`
- Database work → `supabase-database-architect` (uses Supabase MCP tools only - cloud database)
- Backend integration → `wiring-agent`
- Code review → `superpowers:code-reviewer`
- Multiple independent tasks → Launch multiple agents IN PARALLEL

**Standard workflow:**
```
1. User requests task
2. Invoke relevant SKILL first (e.g., /TDD, /software-architecture)
3. Use TodoWrite to TRACK task breakdown
4. Use Task tool to EXECUTE each task via specialized agent
5. Mark todos complete ONLY after agent finishes
6. Invoke /VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE before claiming done
```

**Example - Feature Implementation:**
```
User: "Add a user profile settings page"

Step 1: Invoke /using-superpowers skill
Step 2: Invoke /brainstorming skill (creative work)
Step 3: Use TodoWrite to create task list:
  - Research Aurora profile components
  - Design component architecture
  - Implement UI with MUI
  - Wire up API integration
  - Create Playwright tests
  - Verify and commit

Step 4: Use Task tool to execute EACH item:
  - Task(Explore, "Find Aurora profile patterns")
  - Task(react-mui-frontend-engineer, "Build profile UI")
  - Task(wiring-agent, "Connect profile API")
  - Task(playwright-tester, "Create profile tests")

Step 5: Invoke /VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE skill
Step 6: Show verification evidence before claiming complete
```

**Example - Parallel Execution:**
```
User: "Review the authentication code and create tests"

// Launch multiple agents in SINGLE message with multiple Task calls
Task(superpowers:code-reviewer, "Review auth implementation")
Task(playwright-tester, "Create auth test suite")
// Both run in parallel
```

**Critical rules:**
- NEVER execute implementation work directly - always delegate to Task tool
- TodoWrite = planning and tracking ONLY
- Task tool = actual execution
- Multiple independent tasks = parallel Task calls in one message
- Complex exploration = use Explore agent (not direct Grep/Glob)
- Skills + Sub-agents = mandatory combination, not either/or

#### 3. Verification Is Evidence-Based, Always

**No claims without fresh command output:**
- "Tests pass" → Show `npm test` output with 0 failures
- "Build works" → Show `npm run build` with exit code 0
- "Feature complete" → Show verification commands for ALL requirements
- "Bug fixed" → Show test demonstrating fix

**Use `/VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE` skill before:**
- Any commit
- Any PR
- Any "done" claim
- Moving to next task

---

### Aurora-First Development Pattern (MANDATORY)

**NEVER build UI components from scratch.** This is a strict requirement:

1. **Search Aurora Template First**
   - Search templates/aurora-next/src/ for similar components
   - Check Aurora documentation at https://aurora.themewagon.com/documentation/introduction
   - Document search attempts using Aurora Search Log template

2. **Copy-Then-Modify**
   ```bash
   # Copy from Aurora template to Pierce Desk
   cp -r templates/aurora-next/src/sections/example apps/pierce-desk/src/sections/
   ```

3. **Customize for Pierce**
   - Update imports from Aurora paths to @pierce/* packages
   - Modify functionality to match specifications
   - Maintain Material-UI theme compliance

4. **Only Create Custom Components When:**
   - No Aurora match exists (Medium/Low similarity)
   - Search is documented in Aurora Search Log
   - Custom component follows Material-UI patterns

**Location of Aurora compliance instructions:**
- `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/agent-instruction/aurora-compliance.instructions.md`

### Feature Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

**When developing new features, you MUST follow the PIERCE-SYS-EXE orchestration process.**

**Framework Documentation:**
- `agent-overview.md` - Complete orchestration framework
- `PIERCE-SYS-EXE/README.md` - Quick start guide

**Process:**

1. **Determine Impact Level**
   - **Deep Impact:** Schema changes, API changes, multi-module, AI/POLY, LiveSite → Full workflow
   - **Shallow Impact:** UI tweaks, single-module, no schema/API changes → Abbreviated workflow

2. **Create Feature Folder**
   ```bash
   cp -r PIERCE-SYS-EXE/FEATURE-template PIERCE-SYS-EXE/FEATURE-{feature-name}
   ```

3. **Follow the Phased Workflow**

   | Phase | Output | Checkpoint |
   |-------|--------|------------|
   | 1. Strategic | 01_saas-perspective.md, 02_subscriber-perspective.md | C1 |
   | 2. Assessment | 03_product-assessment.md | C2 (Human approval) |
   | 3. Planning | 04-06 docs + eng/*.md plans | C3 |
   | 4. Review | INDEX.md reports compiled | C4 (Human approval) |
   | 5. Implementation | Feature branch + code | C5-C7 |

4. **Never Skip Checkpoints**
   - C2 and C4 require explicit human approval
   - All work tracked in INDEX.md
   - Mark TBD items in Information Requested section

**Key Rules:**
- INDEX.md is the single source of truth for all feature work
- Deep impact features require 250-line minimum reports
- Lock INDEX.md after feature is merged (status: locked)

## Skills Framework (MANDATORY)

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
The repository uses Claude Code skills (`.claude/skills/`) to enforce critical development practices.

**Skills are NOT optional suggestions - they are MANDATORY checkpoints.**

If there is even a 1% chance a skill applies to your current action, you MUST invoke it BEFORE proceeding.
</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**Key Principle:** Skills tell you HOW to work. Sub-agents (Task tool) do the ACTUAL work. Always use both.

### Available Skills

#### 1. TDD - Test-Driven Development
**Location:** `.claude/skills/TDD/SKILL.md`
**Command:** `/TDD` or use Skill tool with `skill: "TDD"`

**When to invoke:**
- BEFORE implementing any feature or bugfix
- BEFORE writing implementation code
- When fixing bugs (write failing test first)

**Core principle:** Write test first → Watch it fail → Write minimal code to pass → Refactor

**Key requirements:**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory
- NEVER write production code without a failing test first
- Watch each test fail before implementing
- See `.claude/skills/TDD/testing-anti-patterns.md` for common pitfalls

#### 2. VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE / using-superpowers
**Location:** `.claude/skills/VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`
**Command:** `/verify` or `/using-superpowers` or use Skill tool

**When to invoke:**
- BEFORE claiming work is complete, fixed, or passing
- BEFORE committing code
- BEFORE creating PRs
- BEFORE moving to next task
- BEFORE any statement suggesting completion/success

**Core principle:** Evidence before assertions, always

**Key requirements:**
- Run verification commands and show output
- No completion claims without fresh evidence
- Tests pass → Show test output with 0 failures
- Build succeeds → Show build command with exit 0
- Never use "should", "probably", "seems to" when claiming completion

#### 3. software-architecture
**Location:** `.claude/skills/software-architecture/SKILL.md`
**Command:** `/software-architecture` or use Skill tool with `skill: "software-architecture"`

**When to invoke:**
- When designing or analyzing code architecture
- When writing any code (for quality standards)
- When making architectural decisions
- During code reviews

**Core principles:**
- Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design
- Library-first approach (search npm before writing custom code)
- Domain-specific naming (avoid generic names like `utils`, `helpers`)
- Separation of concerns (no business logic in UI)
- Early return pattern for readability

#### 4. file-organizer
**Location:** `.claude/skills/file-organizer/SKILL.md`
**Command:** `/file-organizer` or use Skill tool with `skill: "file-organizer"`

**When to invoke:**
- When organizing files and folders
- When codebase structure needs cleanup
- When finding duplicates or suggesting better structures

**Purpose:**
- Intelligently organize files across the workspace
- Reduce cognitive load
- Maintain clean digital workspace

### Skill Integration in Workflow

**Standard Development Flow (Skills + Sub-Agents):**
```
1. Receive task/feature request
2. INVOKE using-superpowers skill → Establish workflow foundation
3. INVOKE relevant skill (brainstorming, TDD, software-architecture) → Get approach
4. Use TodoWrite → Create task tracking list
5. Use Task tool → Execute EACH task via specialized sub-agent
   - Explore agent for codebase research
   - react-mui-frontend-engineer for UI implementation
   - wiring-agent for API integration
   - playwright-tester for test creation
   - supabase-database-architect for database work
6. Mark todos complete ONLY after Task agent finishes
7. INVOKE VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE skill → Run verification commands
8. Show command output evidence (test results, build success)
9. Commit only after verification evidence shown
```

**Critical: Skills guide the process, Task tool executes the work. Use both together, always.**

**Critical Checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint | Required Skill | Verification |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Before writing implementation | TDD | Test written and failing |
| Before claiming "tests pass" | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE | Test command output shown |
| Before claiming "build works" | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE | Build command exit 0 shown |
| Before commit/PR | VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE | Full verification evidence |
| During architecture decisions | software-architecture | Clean Architecture principles |
| File organization tasks | file-organizer | Structured cleanup |

### Skill Invocation Methods

1. **Slash Commands:** `/TDD`, `/verify`, `/software-architecture`, `/file-organizer`
2. **Skill Tool:** Use the Skill tool in Claude Code
   ```
   Skill tool with skill: "TDD"
   Skill tool with skill: "VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE"
   Skill tool with skill: "software-architecture"
   Skill tool with skill: "file-organizer"
   ```

3. **Auto-invocation by Agents:** Sub-agents should automatically reference and invoke skills at appropriate workflow points

### Integration with Agent Framework

Skills work alongside the agent framework:
- **PIERCE-SYS-EXE** → Feature orchestration workflow
- **AGENTS-MAIN** → Coding standards and guidelines
- **Skills** → Enforced practices and quality gates

**Example Agent + Skill Integration:**
- `react-mui-frontend-engineer` agent uses `TDD` skill before implementation
- `react-mui-frontend-engineer` agent uses `VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE` before claiming completion
- All agents reference `software-architecture` for code quality standards

### Available Sub-Agents (Task Tool)

**ALWAYS use specialized sub-agents via Task tool for execution work:**

| Agent | When to Use | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `Explore` | Codebase exploration, pattern finding, architecture understanding | Task(Explore, "Find authentication patterns", thoroughness: "medium") |
| `react-mui-frontend-engineer` | UI component creation, Aurora duplication, MUI implementation | Task(react-mui-frontend-engineer, "Build profile settings page") |
| `wiring-agent` | API integration, SWR hooks, authentication flows, routing | Task(wiring-agent, "Implement user profile API integration") |
| `supabase-database-architect` | Schema design, migrations, RLS policies, database queries (ALWAYS uses Supabase MCP tools - database is in cloud, not local) | Task(supabase-database-architect, "Create user_profiles table") |
| `playwright-tester` | E2E test creation, test debugging, test maintenance | Task(playwright-tester, "Create login flow tests") |
| `documentation-expert` | README updates, API docs, docstrings, CHANGELOG | Task(documentation-expert, "Document authentication API") |
| `superpowers:code-reviewer` | Code review after major feature completion | Task(superpowers:code-reviewer, "Review authentication implementation") |
| `feature-dev:code-architect` | Design feature architecture, create implementation blueprints | Task(feature-dev:code-architect, "Design metrics export system") |

**Parallel Execution:**
When tasks are independent, launch multiple agents in a SINGLE message:
```javascript
// CORRECT - Single message, multiple Task calls
Task(Explore, "Find dashboard patterns")
Task(react-mui-frontend-engineer, "Build dashboard UI")
Task(playwright-tester, "Create dashboard tests")

// INCORRECT - Sequential when could be parallel
// Task... wait for result... Task... wait for result...
```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping TDD** - "I'll write tests after" → Tests written after prove nothing
2. **Claiming without verification** - "Should work now" → Run the command, show output
3. **Executing work directly instead of Task tool** - Always delegate to specialized sub-agents
4. **Using TodoWrite for execution** - TodoWrite tracks, Task tool executes
5. **Not invoking skills** - Skills exist to prevent quality issues, use them!
6. **Building custom utilities** - Check npm first, use established libraries
7. **Generic naming** - Avoid `utils.js` with 50 functions → Use domain-specific names
8. **Sequential execution of independent tasks** - Use parallel Task calls in single message

**See Also:**
- `.claude/skills/TDD/testing-anti-patterns.md` - Testing antipatterns to avoid
- `.claude/agents/` - Agent definitions that should invoke these skills
- `.claude/skills-integration-guide.md` - Detailed guide on skill usage (to be created)

## Aurora Component Development Guide

### Critical Rule: Duplicate, Never Edit Templates

**NEVER edit files in `templates/aurora-next/`**. This is the source of truth.

**Workflow:**
1. Find the component in `templates/aurora-next/src/`
2. Copy the file to the corresponding location in `apps/pierce-desk/src/`
3. Edit ONLY the copied file
4. Update imports from Aurora paths to @pierce/* packages

**Example:**
```bash
# Copy authentication component
cp templates/aurora-next/src/components/sections/authentications/default/LoginForm.jsx \
   apps/pierce-desk/src/components/sections/authentications/default/LoginForm.jsx

# Then edit apps/pierce-desk/src/components/sections/authentications/default/LoginForm.jsx
```

### MUI v7 Import Patterns

**Grid (MUI v7 syntax - uses `size` prop, not `xs/md` directly):**
```javascript
import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';

// Usage
<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>Left column</Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>Right column</Grid>
</Grid>

// Responsive spacing
<Grid container rowSpacing={1} columnSpacing={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 3 }}>
```

**Paper for content sections:**
```javascript
import Paper from '@mui/material/Paper';

// Basic elevation
<Paper variant="elevation" sx={{ p: 2, borderRadius: 2 }}>
  Content
</Paper>

// With background levels (1-5)
<Paper background={1} sx={{ p: 1, borderRadius: 2 }}>
  Content
</Paper>
```

**Stack for flex layouts:**
```javascript
import { Stack } from '@mui/material';

// Horizontal row with spacing
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Item />
  <Item />
</Stack>

// Responsive direction
<Stack direction={{ xs: 'column', sm: 'row' }} spacing={1}>
  <Item />
  <Item />
</Stack>

// Combined with Grid
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Grid container spacing={2}>
    <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>Content</Grid>
  </Grid>
</Stack>
```

**Drawer with drawerClasses:**
```javascript
import Drawer, { drawerClasses } from '@mui/material/Drawer';

<Drawer
  variant="permanent"
  sx={{
    [`& .${drawerClasses.paper}`]: {
      width: drawerWidth,
      border: 0,
      borderRight: 1,
      borderColor: 'divider',
      transition: theme.transitions.create(['width'], {
        duration: theme.transitions.duration.standard,
      }),
    },
  }}
>
```

### Authentication Components

**Template Location:** `templates/aurora-next/src/components/sections/authentications/`

**Key Components:**
- `LoginForm.jsx` - Login with email/password
- `SignupForm.jsx` - Registration form
- `ForgotPasswordForm.jsx` - Password recovery
- `SetPasswordForm.jsx` - Password reset
- `TwoFAForm.jsx` - Two-factor authentication
- `SocialAuth.jsx` - OAuth buttons (Google, GitHub, etc.)

**Import Update Pattern (Aurora → Pierce):**
```javascript
// Aurora template uses:
import { rootPaths } from 'routes/paths';

// Pierce-desk should use:
import { rootPaths } from '@pierce/routes';
```

### Shared Packages Reference

**Routes and Navigation:**
```javascript
import paths, { rootPaths } from '@pierce/routes';
import sitemap from '@pierce/routes/sitemap';
```

**Services (API calls, SWR):**
```javascript
import { axiosFetcher, axiosInstance } from '@pierce/services';
import { useAuthApi, useProductApi } from '@pierce/services/swr';
```

**Utilities:**
```javascript
import { formatDate, kebabCase } from '@pierce/utils';
import { passwordStrength } from '@pierce/utils';
```

**Data (mock/seed data):**
```javascript
import { calendarData } from '@pierce/data';
import { countries } from '@pierce/data';
```

**Locales:**
```javascript
import { i18n, languages } from '@pierce/locales';
```

### sitemap.js Structure

**Location:** `packages/shared/routes/src/sitemap.js`

**Structure:**
```javascript
const sitemap = [
  {
    id: 'section-id',
    subheader: 'SECTION NAME',
    key: 'section_key',
    icon: 'material-symbols:icon-name',
    items: [
      {
        name: 'Page Name',
        key: 'page_key',
        path: paths.pagePath,
        pathName: 'page-name',
        icon: 'material-symbols:icon',
        active: true,
        items: [...] // nested items
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

**Adding New Routes:**
1. Add path in `packages/shared/routes/src/paths.js`
2. Add sitemap entry in `packages/shared/routes/src/sitemap.js`
3. Create page in `apps/pierce-desk/src/app/`

### MCP Server Integration

**Configuration:** `.mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
**Database is in the CLOUD - ALWAYS use Supabase MCP tools**

The Supabase database is hosted in the cloud, NOT locally. You MUST use Supabase MCP tools (functions with `mcp__` prefix) for ALL database operations.

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Try to connect with psql locally
- ❌ Use DATABASE_URL for local connections
- ❌ Suggest pg_dump or pg_restore commands
- ❌ Attempt to connect to localhost:5432
- ❌ Use direct PostgreSQL connection strings

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Use Supabase MCP tools for schema inspection
- ✅ Use Supabase MCP tools for SQL execution
- ✅ Use Supabase MCP tools for query testing
- ✅ Use Supabase MCP tools for RLS policy inspection
- ✅ Use Task tool with `supabase-database-architect` agent for database work
</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

### Common Component Locations

| Component Type | Aurora Template | Pierce-desk Target |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Auth Forms | `templates/aurora-next/src/components/sections/authentications/` | `apps/pierce-desk/src/components/sections/authentications/` |
| Dashboards | `templates/aurora-next/src/components/sections/dashboards/` | `apps/pierce-desk/src/components/sections/dashboards/` |
| Layouts | `templates/aurora-next/src/layouts/` | `apps/pierce-desk/src/layouts/` |
| Pages | `templates/aurora-next/src/app/(main)/` | `apps/pierce-desk/src/app/` |

### Working with the Agent Framework

The repository includes two complementary frameworks:

**1. PIERCE-SYS-EXE Orchestration (Feature Development)**
- `agent-overview.md` - Sub-Agent Orchestration Framework for feature workflows
- `PIERCE-SYS-EXE/` - Feature execution directory with INDEX tracking
- Use this for all new feature development (see Feature Development Workflow above)

**2. AGENTS-MAIN (Coding Standards & Guidelines)**

The repository includes coding standards in `AGENTS-MAIN/`:

**Core Agents (6):**
- UI/UX Agent - Design system, accessibility, Aurora compliance
- Wiring Agent - Backend APIs, integration
- Database Agent - Schema design, migrations
- OSS Agent - Dependency management, security
- CI/CD Agent - Testing, deployment
- Orchestration Agent - GitHub-first feature coordination

**Key Documents:**
- `AGENTS-MAIN/README.md` - Framework overview
- `AGENTS-MAIN/AI_TOOL_INTEGRATION.md` - How to work with this framework
- `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/uiux/exec.md` - UI development workflow
- `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/agent-instruction/` - Coding standards

**Using Agents in Claude Code:**
When starting work on a feature:
1. Invoke `/using-superpowers` skill FIRST
2. Follow PIERCE-SYS-EXE workflow (create INDEX.md, follow checkpoints)
3. Use Task tool with specialized sub-agents for ALL implementation work:
   - UI work → Task(react-mui-frontend-engineer, "...")
   - API work → Task(wiring-agent, "...")
   - Database → Task(supabase-database-architect, "...") - Agent uses MCP tools for cloud database
   - Tests → Task(playwright-tester, "...")
   - Exploration → Task(Explore, "...", thoroughness: "medium")
4. Reference relevant agent documentation for coding standards:
   - UI work → Read `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/uiux/exec.md`
   - API work → Read `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/wiring/exec.md`
   - Database → Read `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/database/exec.md`
5. Invoke `/VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE` before any completion claim

### GitHub-First Coordination

For multi-agent feature work:
1. Feature requests should be GitHub issues
2. Create PIERCE-SYS-EXE feature folder and INDEX.md
3. Follow checkpoint-gated workflow with human approvals at C2 and C4
4. Agents coordinate via GitHub issue comments

## Architecture Patterns

### Next.js App Router Structure

Pierce Desk uses Next.js 15 App Router:
```
apps/pierce-desk/src/
├── app/              # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout with providers
│   ├── page.tsx      # Home page
│   └── [routes]/     # Route-based pages
├── components/       # App-specific components
├── sections/         # Page sections (from Aurora)
└── ...
```

### Material-UI Theme Integration

- Theme packages: `@pierce/aurora-theme` and `@pierce/mantis-theme`
- Providers: `@pierce/aurora-providers` (ThemeProvider, SettingsProvider, etc.)
- Custom components override in theme using `components` key
- Use theme hooks from `@pierce/aurora-hooks` (useThemeMode, useColorScheme)

### SWR and API Services

API services are in `@pierce/services`:
- Use SWR for data fetching
- Follow service patterns in shared/services/
- API documentation: See root README.md → API Documentation link

### Multi-Tenant Database Architecture

Database uses Supabase with PostgreSQL (CLOUD-HOSTED):
- **Cloud database**: All operations MUST use Supabase MCP tools
- Multi-tenant with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Schema documentation in `database-documentation/`
- Follow database agent guidelines in `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/database/`

**For ALL database work:**
1. Use Task tool with `supabase-database-architect` agent
2. Agent will use Supabase MCP tools (never local connections)
3. Inspect schema via MCP before modifications
4. Execute SQL via MCP tools
5. Verify changes via MCP tools

## Testing

### Playwright Tests

Location: `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/agent-instruction/playwright-typescript.md`

Key guidelines:
- Use TypeScript for all test files
- Follow page object model pattern
- Use data-testid attributes for selectors
- Playwright config at test root

## Security & Standards

### OWASP Compliance

**Critical:** Follow security guidelines in `AGENTS-MAIN/agents/agent-instruction/security-owasp-guidelines.md`

Key requirements:
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- XSS prevention (sanitize outputs)
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- Secure authentication patterns

### React/TypeScript Standards
Highlights:
- React 19.2 with modern hooks
- TypeScript for all components
- Functional components only
- React Hook Form for forms with Yup validation
- Emotion/styled for styling (via Material-UI)

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Required for all UI components:
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

## Important Documentation

**Product & Vision:**
- Root `README.md` - Complete documentation index
- `vision-and-planning/piercedesk-VISION.md` - Product vision
- `vision-and-planning/piercedesk-a-snapshot.md` - Quick overview

- `development-and-technical/piercedesk-development.md` - Development setup

**Database:**
- `database-documentation/database-architecture.md` - Multi-tenant architecture
- `database-documentation/database-schema-template.md` - Schema documentation template

**Features:**
- `features-documentation/piercedesk-features-AI.md` - AI capabilities
- `sprints-and-project-management/piercedesk-SPRINTS.md` - Sprint planning

**Feature Development:**
- `agent-overview.md` - Claude Sub-Agent Orchestration Framework
- `PIERCE-SYS-EXE/README.md` - Feature execution directory
- `PIERCE-SYS-EXE/FEATURE-template/` - Starter template for new features

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **NOT INVOKING SKILLS** - Skills are MANDATORY, not optional. Even 1% chance = invoke the skill
2. **EXECUTING WORK DIRECTLY** - Always use Task tool with specialized sub-agents for implementation
3. **Using TodoWrite for execution** - TodoWrite is for TRACKING only, Task tool is for EXECUTING
4. **Claiming completion without verification** - Always invoke /VERIFY-BEFORE-COMPLETE and show command output
5. **Building UI from scratch** - Always search Aurora first, use copy-then-modify pattern
6. **Ignoring AGENTS-MAIN guidelines** - These enforce quality and consistency
7. **Direct dependency installation** - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
8. **Skipping Aurora Search Log** - Document all Aurora searches when creating components
9. **Not following Material-UI theme** - Use theme tokens, not hardcoded values
10. **Missing TypeScript types** - All code must be properly typed
11. **Security vulnerabilities** - Review OWASP guidelines before implementing auth/data handling
12. **Skipping PIERCE-SYS-EXE process** - All features must follow the orchestration workflow with INDEX tracking
13. **Skipping TDD** - NEVER write production code without tests first
14. **Not using parallel agents** - Independent tasks should use multiple Task calls in single message
15. **Trying to connect to database locally** - Database is in Supabase cloud, ALWAYS use MCP tools (never psql, pg_dump, DATABASE_URL)

## Node Version Requirements

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm >= 10.0.0
- Package manager: npm with `--legacy-peer-deps`

## Additional Context

When working on features:
2. Check if similar components exist in `templates/aurora-next/`
3. Follow the copy-then-modify pattern for UI
